Description:
  'Measurements of double-differential inclusive cross-sections of the production of secondary protons and charged pions with momentum from $\pm$ 3 GeV/c to $\pm$ 15 GeV/c in pion-nucleus fixed-target collision set-up. Collisions are made between charged pion projectiles and a thin carbon target. Results are given for secondary particles with production angles between 20 and 125 degrees.'
