RunInfo: Total cross-section for fixed-target events for a range of projectiles (proton, antiproton, charged kaons, charged pions), and targets (proton, deuteron, neutron), for discrete lab momenta ranging from 23 to 280 GeV/c. 
Beams: [p+, p+], [p+, d+], [p+, n+], [p-, p+], [p-, d+], [p-, n+], [k+, p+], [k+, d+], [k+, n+], [k-, p+], [k-, d+], [k-, n+], [pi+, p+], [pi+, d+], [pi-, p+], [pi-, d+]
Energies: [23.,0.], [35.,0.], [50.,0.], [70.,0.], [100.,0.], [120.,0.], [150.,0.], [170.,0.], [200.,0.], [240.,0.], [280.,0.]

Description:
  'Total cross-sections of $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, $p$, and $\overline{p}$ projectiles​, with momenta between 23 GeV/c and 280 GeV/c, on protons, deuterons fixed targets. The cross sections for target neutrons have been obtained from those on protons and deuterons using the Glauber-Wilkin procedure. The discrete projectile lab momentum are 23, 35, 50, 70, 100, 120, 150, 170, 200, 240 and 280 GeV/c.'

ToDo:
 - Handle several projectile momentum input
 - Merge into a single d0i-x01-y01 the several rows (one per projectile plab)
 - Handle ratios: reentrant plugin?
