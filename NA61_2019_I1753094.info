Description:
  'Measurements of production $\sigma_{\mathrm{prod}}$ and inelastic $\sigma_{\mathrm{inel}}$ cross-sections for 60 and 120 GeV/c protons with a carbon target. The production process is defined as that in which new hadrons are produced. $\sigma_{\mathrm{inel}} = \sigma_{\mathrm{tot}} - \sigma_{\mathrm{el}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{prod}} = \sigma_{\mathrm{inel}} - \sigma_{\mathrm{qe}}$, with the coherent elastic cross section $\sigma_{\mathrm{el}}$, and the quasielastic cross section $\sigma_{\mathrm{qe}}$.'
